Changelog
=========

Version 0.7.0 (February 16, 2020)
---------------------------------

Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped. GeoPandas now works with Python >= 3.5.

The important API change of this release is that GeoPandas now requires
PROJ > 6 and pyproj > 2.2, and that the `.crs` attribute of a GeoSeries and
GeoDataFrame no longer stores the CRS information as a proj4 string or dict,
but as a ``pyproj.CRS`` object (#1101).

This gives a better user interface and integrates improvements from pyproj and
PROJ 6, but might also require some changes in your code. Check the
[migration guide](https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projections.html#upgrading-to-geopandas-0-7-with-pyproj-2-2-and-proj-6)
in the documentation.

Other API changes;

- The `GeoDataFrame.to_file` method will now also write the GeoDataFrame index
  to the file, if the index is named and/or non-integer. You can use the
  `index=True/False` keyword to overwrite this default inference (#1059).

New features and improvements:

- A new `geopandas.clip` function to clip a GeoDataFrame to the spatial extent
  of another shape (#1128).
- The `geopandas.overlay` function now works for all geometry types, including
  points and linestrings in addition to polygons (#1110).
- The `plot()` method gained support for missing values (in the column that
  determines the colors). By default it doesn't plot the corresponding
  geometries, but using the new `missing_kwds` argument you can specify how to
  style those geometries (#1156).
- The `plot()` method now also supports plotting GeometryCollection and
  LinearRing objects (#1225).
- Added support for filtering with a geometry or reading a subset of the rows in
  `geopandas.read_file` (#1160).
- Added support for the new nullable integer data type of pandas in
  `GeoDataFrame.to_file` (#1220).

Bug fixes:

- `GeoSeries.reset_index()` now correctly results in a GeoDataFrame instead of DataFrame (#1252).
- Fixed the `geopandas.sjoin` function to handle MultiIndex correctly (#1159).
- Fixed the `geopandas.sjoin` function to preserve the index name of the left GeoDataFrame (#1150).


Version 0.6.3 (February 6, 2020)
---------------------------------

Small bug-fix release:

- Compatibility with Shapely 1.7 and pandas 1.0 (#1244).
- Fix `GeoDataFrame.fillna` to accept non-geometry values again when there are
  no missing values in the geometry column. This should make it easier to fill
  the numerical columns of the GeoDataFrame (#1279).


Version 0.6.2 (November 18, 2019)
---------------------------------

Small bug-fix release fixing a few regressions:

- Fix a regression in passing an array of RRB(A) tuples to the ``.plot()``
  method (#1178, #1211).
- Fix the ``bounds`` and ``total_bounds`` attributes for empty GeoSeries, which
  also fixes the repr of an empty or all-NA GeoSeries (#1184, #1195).
- Fix filtering of a GeoDataFrame to preserve the index type when ending up
  with an empty result (#1190).


Version 0.6.1 (October 12, 2019)
--------------------------------

Small bug-fix release fixing a few regressions:

- Fix `astype` when converting to string with Multi geometries (#1145) or when converting a dataframe without geometries (#1144).
- Fix `GeoSeries.fillna` to accept `np.nan` again (#1149).


Version 0.6.0 (September 27, 2019)
----------------------------------

Important note! This will be the last release to support Python 2.7 (#1031)

API changes:

- A refactor of the internals based on the pandas ExtensionArray interface (#1000). The main user visible changes are:
  - The `.dtype` of a GeoSeries is now a `'geometry'` dtype (and no longer a numpy `object` dtype).
  - The `.values` of a GeoSeries now returns a custom `GeometryArray`, and no longer a numpy array. To get back a numpy array of Shapely scalars, you can convert explicitly using `np.asarray(..)`.
- The `GeoSeries` constructor now raises a warning when passed non-geometry data. Currently the constructor falls back to return a pandas `Series`, but in the future this will raise an error (#1085).
- The missing value handling has been changed to now separate the concepts of missing geometries and empty geometries (#601, 1062). In practice this means that (see [the docs](https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.0/missing_empty.html) for more details):
  - `GeoSeries.isna` now considers only missing values, and if you want to check for empty geometries, you can use `GeoSeries.is_empty` (`GeoDataFrame.isna` already only looked at missing values).
  - `GeoSeries.dropna` now actually drops missing values (before it didn't drop either missing or empty geometries)
  - `GeoSeries.fillna` only fills missing values (behaviour unchanged).
  - `GeoSeries.align` uses missing values instead of empty geometries by default to fill non-matching index entries.

New features and improvements:

- Addition of a `GeoSeries.affine_transform` method, equivalent of Shapely's function (#1008).
- Addition of a `GeoDataFrame.rename_geometry` method to easily rename the active geometry column (#1053).
- Addition of `geopandas.show_versions()` function, which can be used to give an overview of the installed libraries in bug reports (#899).
- The `legend_kwds` keyword of the `plot()` method can now also be used to specify keywords for the color bar (#1102).
- Performance improvement in the `sjoin()` operation by re-using existing spatial index of the input dataframes, if available (#789).
- Updated documentation to work with latest version of geoplot and contextily (#1044, #1088).
- A new ``geopandas.options`` configuration, with currently a single option to control the display precision of the coordinates (``options.display_precision``). The default is now to show less coordinates (3 for projected and 5 for geographic coordinates), but the default can be overridden with the option.

Bug fixes:

- Also try to use `pysal` instead of `mapclassify` if available (#1082).
- The `GeoDataFrame.astype()` method now correctly returns a `GeoDataFrame` if the geometry column is preserved (#1009).
- The `to_crs` method now uses `always_xy=True` to ensure correct lon/lat order handling for pyproj>=2.2.0 (#1122).
- Fixed passing list-like colors in the `plot()` method in case of "multi" geometries (#1119).
- Fixed the coloring of shapes and colorbar when passing a custom `norm` in the `plot()` method (#1091, #1089).
- Fixed `GeoDataFrame.to_file` to preserve VFS file paths (e.g. when a "s3://" path is specified) (#1124).
- Fixed failing case in ``geopandas.sjoin`` with empty geometries (#1138).


In addition, the minimum required versions of some dependencies have been increased: GeoPandas now requirs pandas >=0.23.4 and matplotlib >=2.0.1 (#1002).


Version 0.5.1 (July 11, 2019)
-----------------------------

- Compatibility with latest mapclassify version 2.1.0 (#1025).

Version 0.5.0 (April 25, 2019)
------------------------------

Improvements:

* Significant performance improvement (around 10x) for `GeoDataFrame.iterfeatures`,
  which also improves `GeoDataFrame.to_file` (#864).
* File IO enhancements based on Fiona 1.8:
    * Support for writing bool dtype (#855) and datetime dtype, if the file format supports it (#728).
    * Support for writing dataframes with multiple geometry types, if the file format allows it (e.g. GeoJSON for all types, or ESRI Shapefile for Polygon+MultiPolygon) (#827, #867, #870).
* Compatibility with pyproj >= 2 (#962).
* A new `geopandas.points_from_xy()` helper function to convert x and y coordinates to Point objects (#896).
* The `buffer` and `interpolate` methods now accept an array-like to specify a variable distance for each geometry (#781). 
* Addition of a `relate` method, corresponding to the shapely method that returns the DE-9IM matrix (#853).
* Plotting improvements:
    * Performance improvement in plotting by only flattening the geometries if there are actually 'Multi' geometries (#785).
    * Choropleths: access to all `mapclassify` classification schemes and addition of the `classification_kwds` keyword in the `plot` method to specify options for the scheme (#876).
    * Ability to specify a matplotlib axes object on which to plot the color bar with the `cax` keyword, in order to have more control over the color bar placement (#894).
* Changed the default provider in ``geopandas.tools.geocode`` from Google (now requires an API key) to Geocode.Farm (#907, #975).

Bug fixes:

- Remove the edge in the legend marker (#807).
- Fix the `align` method to preserve the CRS (#829).

- Fix in `read_postgis` to handle nullable (missing) geometries (#856).
- Correctly passing through the `parse_dates` keyword in `read_postgis` to the underlying pandas method (#860).
