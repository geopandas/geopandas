    "# Introduction to GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This quick tutorial provides an introduction to the key concepts of GeoPandas. In a few minutes, we'll describe the basics which allow you to start your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas, as the name suggests, extends popular data science library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) by adding support for geospatial data. If you are not familiar with `pandas`, we recommend taking a quick look at its [Getting started documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in GeoPandas is `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame` able to store geometry columns and perform spatial operations. Geometries are handled by `geopandas.GeoSeries`, a subclass of `pandas.Series`. Therefore, your `GeoDataFrame` is a combination of `Series` with your data (numerical, boolean, text etc.) and `GeoSeries` with geometries (points, polygons etc.). You can have as many columns with geometries as you wish, there's no limit typical for desktop GIS software.\n",
    "\n",
    "![geodataframe schema](../_static/dataframe.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `GeoSeries` can contain any geometry type (we can even mix them within a single array) and has a `GeoSeries.crs` attribute, which stores information on the projection (CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System). Therefore, each `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` can be in a different projection, allowing you to have, for example, multiple versions of the same geometry, just in a different CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "One `GeoSeries` within a `GeoDataFrame` is seen as the _active_ geometry, which means that all geometric operations applied to a `GeoDataFrame` use the specified column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "User Guide\n",
    "    \n",
    "See more on [data structures in the User Guide](../docs/user_guide/data_structures.rst).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and writing files\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to read some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read files\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we have a file containing both data and geometry (e.g. GeoPackage, GeoJSON, Shapefile), we can easily read it using `geopandas.read_file` function, which automatically detects filetype and creates a `GeoDataFrame`. In this example, we'll use the `\"nybb\"` dataset, a map of New York boroughs which is part of GeoPandas installation. Therefore we need to get the path to the actual file. With your file, you specify a path as a string (`\"my_data/my_file.geojson\"`)."

    "\n",
    "### Measuring area\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the area of each polygon (or MultiPolygon in this specific case), we can use `GeoDataFrame.area` attribute, which returns a `pandas.Series`. Note that `GeoDataFrame.area` is just `GeoSeries.area` applied to an active geometry column.\n",
