    "# Introduction to GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This quick tutorial introduces the key concepts and basic features of GeoPandas to help you get started with your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas, as the name suggests, extends the popular data science library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) by adding support for geospatial data. If you are not familiar with `pandas`, we recommend taking a quick look at its [Getting started documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame`, that can store geometry columns and perform spatial operations. The `geopandas.GeoSeries`, a subclass of `pandas.Series`, handles the geometries. Therefore, your `GeoDataFrame` is a combination of `pandas.Series`, with traditional data (numerical, boolean, text etc.), and `geopandas.GeoSeries`, with geometries (points, polygons etc.). You can have as many columns with geometries as you wish; there's no limit unlike some typical desktop GIS software.\n",
    "\n",
    "![geodataframe schema](../_static/dataframe.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `GeoSeries` can contain any geometry type (you can even mix them within a single array) and has a `GeoSeries.crs` attribute, which stores information about the projection (CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System). Therefore, each `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` can be in a different projection, allowing you to have, for example, multiple versions (different projections) of the same geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` is considered the _active_ geometry, which means that all geometric operations applied to a `GeoDataFrame` operate on this _active_ column.\n",
    "The active geometry column is accessed via the `GeoDataFrame.geometry` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "User guide\n",
    "    \n",
    "See more on [data structures](../docs/user_guide/data_structures.rst) in the user guide.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how some of these concepts work in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading and writing files\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to read some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading files\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have a file containing both data and geometry (e.g. GeoPackage, GeoJSON, Shapefile), you can read it using `geopandas.read_file()`, which automatically detects the filetype and creates a `GeoDataFrame`. This tutorial uses the `\"nybb\"` dataset, a map of New York boroughs, which is available through the `geodatasets` package. Therefore, we use `geodatasets.get_path()` to download the dataset and retrieve the path to the local copy."
