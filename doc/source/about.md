GeoPandas is an open source project to add support for geographic data to pandas objects. It
currently implements `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` types which are subclasses of
`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrame` respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on
`shapely` geometry objects and perform geometric operations.

GeoPandas is a community-led project written, used and supported by a wide range of
people from all around of world of a large variety of backgrounds. Want to get involved
in the community? See our [community guidelines](community).

GeoPandas will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released

became the maintainer of the project. Since the beginning, GeoPandas is a BSD-licensed
open-source project supported by a [community of
contributors](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/graphs/contributors) from around
the world and is now maintained by a [team](about/team) of core developers.

In 2020 GeoPandas became [NumFOCUS Affiliated
Project](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects) and received two
[Small Development Grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/sustainability) to support its
development. In 2023, GeoPandas became [NumFOCUS Sponsored
  Project](https://numfocus.org/project/geopandas).
