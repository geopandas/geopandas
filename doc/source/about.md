GeoPandas is an open source project to add support for geographic data to pandas objects. It
currently implements `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` types which are subclasses of
`pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrame` respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on
`shapely` geometry objects and perform geometric operations.

A wide range of people from all around the world with diverse backgrounds write, use, and support GeoPandas as a community-led project. Want to get involved
in the community? See our [community guidelines](community).

The GeoPandas community will always distribute GeoPandas as 100% open source software under the liberal terms of the BSD-3-Clause license.

## Project history

Kelsey Jordahl founded GeoPandas project in 2013 during the Scipy Conference and
released a version 0.1.0 in July 2014. In 2016, Joris Van den Bossche took the lead and
became the maintainer of the project. Since the beginning, a [community of
contributors](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/graphs/contributors) from around
the world has supported GeoPandas as a BSD-licensed open-source project, and a [team](about/team) of core developers now maintains it.

In 2020, NumFOCUS designated GeoPandas as an [Affiliated
Project](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects/affiliated-projects) and awarded it two
[Small Development Grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/sustainability) to support its
development. In 2023, NumFOCUS designated GeoPandas as a [Sponsored
  Project](https://numfocus.org/project/geopandas).
