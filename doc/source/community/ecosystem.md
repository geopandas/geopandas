## GeoPandas dependencies

GeoPandas brings together the full capability of `pandas` and the open-source geospatial
tools `Shapely`, which brings manipulation and analysis of geometric objects backed by
[`GEOS`](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos) library, `Fiona`, allowing us to read and write
geographic data files using [`GDAL`](https://gdal.org), and `pyproj`, a library for
cartographic projections and coordinate transformations, which is a Python interface to
[`PROJ`](https://proj.org).

Furthermore, GeoPandas has several optional dependencies as `rtree`, `pygeos`,
`mapclassify`, or `geopy`.

### Required dependencies

#### [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
`pandas` is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional,
potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be
the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis
in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and
flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is
already well on its way toward this goal.

#### [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely)
`Shapely` is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar
geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed `GEOS` (the engine of PostGIS) and
`JTS` (from which `GEOS` is ported) libraries. `Shapely` is not concerned with data
formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily integrated with packages that are.

#### [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona)
`Fiona` is `GDALâ€™s` neat and nimble vector API for Python programmers. Fiona is designed
to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and writing data in standard Python
IO style and relies upon familiar Python types and protocols such as files,
dictionaries, mappings, and iterators instead of classes specific to `OGR`. Fiona can
read and write real-world data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file
systems and integrates readily with other Python GIS packages such as `pyproj`, `Rtree`,
and `Shapely`.

#### [pyproj](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj)
`pyproj` is a Python interface to `PROJ` (cartographic projections and coordinate
transformations library). GeoPandas uses a `pyproj.crs.CRS` object to keep track of the
projection of each `GeoSeries` and its `Transformer` object to manage re-projections.

### Optional dependencies

#### [rtree](https://github.com/Toblerity/rtree)
`Rtree` is a ctypes Python wrapper of `libspatialindex` that provides a number of
advanced spatial indexing features for the spatially curious Python user.

#### [PyGEOS](https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos)

operations are done in the open-source geometry library `GEOS`. PyGEOS wraps these
operations in `NumPy` ufuncs providing a performance improvement when operating on
arrays of geometries.

#### [mapclassify](https://github.com/pysal/mapclassify)
`mapclassify` provides functionality for Choropleth map classification. Currently,
fifteen different classification schemes are available, including a highly-optimized
implementation of Fisher-Jenks optimal classification. Each scheme inherits a common
structure that ensures computations are scalable and supports applications in streaming
contexts.

#### [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
`geopy` is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services. `geopy` makes it
easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries,
and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.

#### [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
`Matplotlib` is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive
visualizations in Python. Matplotlib produces publication-quality figures in a variety
of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be
used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and
various graphical user interface toolkits.
